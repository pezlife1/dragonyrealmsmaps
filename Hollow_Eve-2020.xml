    <description>Coral pillars rise from the sandstone of the dock to provide anchorage for a woven mat overhead.  The smooth sandstone slabs of the dock are decorated with interlocking circles made from corals, shells, and gold.  Crates soar in neat stacks, each labeled with the names of famous trading houses.  A few bear the seal of the Merelew, indicating that they are being shipped landside.  A group of Halflings moves cargo about.</description>
    <description>Coral pillars seem to twist upward in the soft green-yellow light of the crystal globes.  Underfoot, the dock is decorated with swirling patterns of coral, shell, and gold.  Neatly stacked in rows are boxes and bales of cargo.  Rising on the hill with the lights sparkling like gleaming gems in the night is the Merelew city, while gazing into the water more lights can be seen.</description>

    <description>Overhead, sea plants woven into a mat spread from pillars of coral to provide shade for the visiting land folk.  Small glass and crystal globes hang from the pillars.  Underfoot, the smooth sandstone is decorated with coral, shells, and gold.  Columns and domes rise up from the water surrounding the dock.  Cargo is being brought in by Merelew workers and then stacked on the dock for sorting.</description>
    <description>Overhead, glowing crystal globes shed a soft green-yellow light on the dock.  Tall coral pillars rise from the sandstone to provide anchorage for the awning overhead.  The smooth sandstone of the dock is decorated with coral, shells, and gold.  In the water, glowing points of light give a glimpse of the true Merelew city.  Soft breezes blow through the pillars, and in the darkness, the sound of the sea murmurs unchanged.</description>

    <description>Traffic swirls in busy patterns across the dock as merchants, Merelew, and guests all meet here.  To one side sits the Customs Inspector's booth, closed for the festival.  To the north, a large building with onion-shaped domes rises over the city.</description>
    <description>Soft green-yellow light falls across the limestone and coral dock.  Crates, bales, boxes, and assorted cargo stand in quiet rows waiting for the dawn.  A coral booth stands to one side, silent and empty.  To the north, lights glitter and sparkle, while the sound of music drifts on the night breeze.</description>

    <description>Cargo stands in neat array on the smooth limestone slabs of the dock.  Overhead, an awning made from woven, ornamental rugs stretches between pillars of coral, providing a measure of shelter.  Hovering among the stacks of merchandise, a Merelew merchant in green silks and an Elf in blue brocade bargain over an open box of pearls.</description>
    <description>The cargo stacked in orderly rows makes comfortable nooks and crannies to sit and view the Merelew city sparkling like a jewel in the dark.  Soft green-yellow light comes from crystal globes on the coral pillars.</description>

    <description>Amid the warm glow of brass oil dish lamps, several gray-scaled guards in green uniforms inspect dossiers and polish and sharpen their weapons.  Maces and scimitars line the walls, along with multi-colored decorations for heroism.  A few also write reports, inspect cabinets for merchandise, and study a roster on the wall.  A Merelew guard captain looks on quietly, taking in all the activity without comment.</description>

    <description>Across the dock all is in disarray, as merchants open crates and boxes, sorting out their cargos.  Busy Merelew carry boxes and bales along the shore, while others haul crates up from the water.  Their task is made more difficult by a couple of still unmended holes in the dock that are covered by sawhorses.</description>
    <description>Neatly stacked crates line the dock, providing convenient access to the road.  Glowing crystal globes shed a soft green-yellow light across the dock, casting the coral into relief.  In the water, lights glitter, and the occasional ripple makes them dance.  A few holes in the dock are blocked off by sawhorses.</description>

    <description>The sandstone paving contrasts with the patterns of interlocking spirals made from coral, shells, platinum, and gold set into the road.  Low buildings of sandstone, decorated with coral and pearlescent shell panels, alternate with tall coral pillars along the route.  A basalt statue faces a marble statue across the way, the icons mostly ignored as passersby stroll north toward the Palace domes or south to the docks.</description>
    <description>The soft green-yellow light reveals two statues on either side of the road.  Low buildings line the way, a cool ocean breeze sighing around them.</description>

    <description>The sandstone road curves up the hill from the docks towards the Palace, avoiding a large coral garden edged with a low wall.  Both the wall and the road have been decorated with coral, shells, platinum, and gold set in abstract patterns, and coral pillars stand at intervals along the route.  A pair of statues frames the garden, across from a coral bench.</description>
    <description>The road curves up the hill from the docks and goes around a coral garden.  Green-yellow light from the hanging globes illuminates twin statues and pillars along the edge, where a low wall prevents casual visitors from wandering into the garden.</description>

    <description>The onion-shaped domes of the palace rise over the coral and sandstone archway that stands astride the terminus of the road.  Standing before the archway is a coral tree, shaped like a great deobar.  Under the branches are benches for people to stop and rest.  On both sides are fountains of sandstone decorated with coral.  The sounds of the water gurgling in the fountains and of the wind blowing through the tree can be heard.</description>
    <description>The road ends at a sandstone and coral archway.  Soft green-yellow light shed from crystal globes illuminates a coral tree in the middle of the road.  The relaxing sound of water comes from fountains that edge the roadway.  Underfoot, the sandstone road is inset with square patterns of shell and coral, highlighted with platinum and gold.</description>

With head and teeth still intact, a massive korograth hide rug cushions every footfall along the floor.  A polished haon libations table is centrally located amidst oiled leather couches, allowing patrons a place to relax and converse while taking a break from perusing the wares amid mannequins of every race -- including Merelew.</description>

    <description>Feather fuzz covers every inch of the dark wooden floor, and each step one takes kicks some of the stuff into the air to float lazily before finding a new surface to cling to.  A stout wooden table bearing folded clothing for sale sits imposingly in the middle of the sales floor, though at a slight off-center angle.  Along one end of the room, wooden poles and jewelry trees lean precariously against one another and the walls.  A cloak rack and a wooden mannequin with a cardinal's head stand together on the other side of the shop, partially obscuring a recessed alcove.</description>

Some mill about in indecisiveness or awe, while others rush to see the fabled Andreshlew.  Kelp-covered pillars of limestone rise above the docks, thick ropes tied to them mooring visiting ships.  The road cuts a swath through the buildings of coral, leading to the heart of the city.</description>

The intersection is filled with the noises of buying and selling, as shoppers haggle over prices and hawkers call out all they have to offer.  Blue-scaled Merelew merge with outlanders to create a virtual impasse of people.  Merelew guards bearing tridents and spears guard the merchants and customers.</description>

    <description>The music increases in volume in this portion of the shop, perhaps to emphasize the lack of instruments for sale here, but still remains fairly subdued.  Shadows cast by the flickering candles play across the walls of the dimly lit room.  Cushioned stands display the wares available for purchase.</description>

    <description>The mother-of-pearl walls are a pristine white, reflecting light in iridescent swirls.  Cabinets are stocked with dyes of every imaginable color and shade.  Comfortable looking benches and stools are spaced about the room.  Small tables are setup in the corners of the shop.</description>

    <description>Colorful fish dart amidst the greenery in a large tank along the far wall of the shop.  Above the tank, water trickles from tier to tier down a roughly carved blue sandstone waterfall, finally tumbling into the tank.  Light reflecting off the surface of the water sends flickering patterns dancing around the room.</description>

    <description>The once spacious workshop is cramped by mechanical flights of fantasy.  Many are little more than carefully annotated blueprints, scattered springs and stray gears, while others proudly proclaim their completion with scribbled price tags.  Some merchandise lies in tangles and piles of clutter, while others sprawl across the workbench, a side table, the assorted shelving and even the walls.</description>

    <description>Belying the simple exterior, cool green stone tiling spreads across the room blending into blue-grey crystalline walls.  A small archway cuts through the back wall and into a dim room beyond.  Lounging behind a counter cut from a large chunk of coral is a very content-looking Merelew.</description>
