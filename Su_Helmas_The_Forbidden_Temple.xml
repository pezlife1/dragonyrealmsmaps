A massive two-tiered chandelier hangs from the domed ceiling, lighting the room with a soft flickering glow that casts distorted shadows over random surfaces.  Walls of bespoke shelving wrap around the circular room each is covered with rows of time-worn books, all neatly ordered and labeled despite being moldy and slightly warped.  Situated near the door, two cracked leather highback chairs face each other separated by a toppled table of marble. </description>

Four massive columns support the room in its center, making them the main focal point in the vast space.

Each deity's eyes are seemingly focused on a frieze depicting the various constellations that runs along the cornice surrounding the room.  Now dusty and threadbare, once plush chairs and sofas face a pair of buffet tables that stretch from one corner to the next.  Framed in intricately carved wood, a wide marble stairwell is blocked by an undulating purple ward.</description>
